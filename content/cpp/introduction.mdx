## C++ Programming Language

1. C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system and application programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. C++ is an object-oriented, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles.

2. One of the key features of C++ is its ability to support low-level, system-level programming, making it suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers, and other system software. At the same time, C++ also provides a rich set of libraries and features for high-level application programming, making it a popular choice for developing desktop applications, video games, and other complex applications.

3. C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, and a wealth of resources and tools available for learning and using the language.

## Some of the key features of C++ include

1. `Object-Oriented Programming`: <span className="text-sm font-thin"> C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create classes and objects and to define methods and properties for these objects. </span>

2. `Templates`: <span className="text-sm font-thin"> C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can work with any data type, making it easier to write reusable and flexible code.</span>

3. `Standard Template Library (STL)`: <span className="text-sm font-thin">The STL provides a wide range of containers and algorithms for working with data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code.</span>

4. `Exception Handling`: <span className="text-sm font-thin">C++ provides robust exception handling capabilities, making it easier to write code that can handle errors and unexpected situations.</span>

> Overall, C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used for a range of applications and is well-suited for both low-level system programming and high-level application development.

## Here are some simple C++ code examples to help you understand the language

```cpp title="hello-world.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

- Output

```terminal
Hello, World!
```

## Applications of C++

- Operating Systems & Systems Programming. e.g. Linux-based OS (Ubuntu etc.)
- Browsers (Chrome & Firefox)
- Graphics & Game engines (Photoshop, Blender, Unreal-Engine)
- Database Engines (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis etc.)
- Cloud/Distributed Systems
